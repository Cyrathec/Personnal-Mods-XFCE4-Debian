# Personnal-Mods-XFCE4-Debian
This is my personnal modifications for XFCE4 Desktop on Debian (12)\
You are free to use it as you want or fork it

Most ideas come from [Kali Linux's Theme](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-themes)\
Some file are even copy/pasted from the repo

## Usage
For now you can use the install scrits that will install everything\
The only issue is that the plguins for the xfce4 panels are not configured automaticaly\
The configuration files are copied to /etc/skel/.config/xfce4/panel/ and are still in the folder but the package doesn't seems to accept them nor allowing us to change the config via cli\
Still WIP on this part, the rest is working it might need some improvement but that's all
